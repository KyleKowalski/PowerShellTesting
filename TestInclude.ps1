# What I'd like to do here is get a standard set of functions that we include in all of the other files.
# This is following the idea of DRY coding (Don't Repeat Yourself) 
# Basically, have code in 1 place if at all possible - and I believe it is possible.
# We can have a general use (things like color) - AD Common - Database Common - etc, try to simplify individual scripts
